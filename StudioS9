/* Questions to ask
1. What is the difference between environment and frames? (Lecture notes state that environments
    are sequence of frames. Does this mean an environment can have more than one frame?)
2. In task 3 of "Know your environment". The final environment is the first d_map, and not the second
    inner d_map. Why is that so?
